# Bangladesh Agricultural University Veterinary Teaching Hospital Management System (BAU-VTHMS)

## Project Overview

The **BAU Veterinary Teaching Hospital Management System (BAU-VTHMS)** is a desktop application designed to modernize and enhance the management of patient records and treatment history at the Bangladesh Agricultural University Veterinary Teaching Hospital. This system aims to provide a centralized digital solution to overcome inefficiencies inherent in manual processes, ultimately improving data accuracy, accessibility, and supporting the critical academic mission of the hospital.

## Features

* **Patient & Owner Registration:** Efficiently register and manage profiles for animal patients and their owners.
* **Electronic Medical Records (EMR):** Comprehensive digital system for recording patient history, clinical notes, diagnostic results, and treatment plans. This includes dedicated features for **prescription management** and the storage of all clinical records.
* **Basic Reporting:** Generate fundamental reports, such as patient visit summaries and inventory levels, for operational insights.
* **Dashboard:** Provides a quick overview of daily activities and key system information.
* **Patient and Owner Search/Retrieval:** Fast and efficient lookup of patient and owner information.

## Technology Stack

The system is developed using:

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **Tkinter:** For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
* **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture:** To ensure a modular, maintainable, and scalable codebase.
* **SQLite3:** As the robust, embedded database system for data storage.

## Installation & Setup

To get a local copy of the BAU-VTHMS application up and running on your system, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/BAU-VTH-Management-System.git](https://github.com/your-username/BAU-VTH-Management-System.git)
    cd BAU-VTH-Management-System
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    *(If your project uses any external Python libraries beyond the standard library (like `pandas`, `openpyxl`, etc.), you would list them in a `requirements.txt` file and instruct users to install them here. For a basic Tkinter/SQLite3 app, external dependencies might be minimal or none.)*
    ```bash
    # Example: pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py  # Or replace 'main.py' with the name of your main application entry file
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you will typically be presented with an interface (e.g., a login screen or a main dashboard) from which you can access various modules like patient registration, EMR entry, and inventory management.
