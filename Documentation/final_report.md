1. Executive Summary

The BAU-VTHMS project was initiated to address the operational inefficiencies and data management challenges faced by the BAU Veterinary Teaching Hospital due 
to its reliance on manual, paper-based systems. The project's primary goal was to develop a digital management system to centralize patient records, 
improve data accuracy, and enhance the hospital's academic and operational functions. 
The developed Minimum Viable Product (MVP) successfully implemented key features, 
including patient and owner registration and basic inventory management, thereby achieving significant milestones 
toward the project's vision.

2. Project Overview

2.1. Problem & Objectives

The project successfully addressed the core problems of operational inefficiencies, data inconsistencies, and limited data accessibility. 
The system provides a centralized digital platform that streamlines patient registration and record retrieval, minimizes human error through digital 
data validation, and offers a readily accessible database for clinical decisions, research, and student learning.

2.2. Goals Achievement

Centralize Data: Achieved through the creation of a PostgreSQL database repository for all patient, owner, and medical records.
Improve Data Accuracy: Achieved by implementing digital data entry and validation checks, reducing the risk of manual errors.
Enhance Learning & Research: The organized digital records provide a structured database for veterinary students and faculty to access case studies.
Reduce Administrative Overhead: The digital system reduces the time spent on manual paperwork and record-keeping.

3. System Design and Implementation

3.1. Architecture

The BAU-VTHMS was designed and implemented using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
This pattern was chosen for its ability to separate the application's data (Model), user interface (View), and control logic (Controller), making the system more modular, maintainable, and scalable.
Model: Handles data logic and database interactions (e.g., patient records, inventory data stored in PostgreSQL).
View: Manages the user interface, developed using the Tkinter GUI toolkit in Python.
Controller: Acts as an intermediary, processing user input from the View and updating the Model and View accordingly.

3.2. Technology Stack

The project was developed using a straightforward and robust technology stack:
Programming Language: Python 
GUI Framework: Tkinter
Database: PostgreSQL

3.3. Key Features Delivered

The MVP successfully delivered the following features:
User Dashboard: A simple dashboard providing an overview of daily activities.
Patient and Owner Management: Functionality for registering new patients and owners, and searching/retrieving existing records.
Electronic Medical Records (EMR): A digital form for veterinarians and students to record patient history, examinations, diagnoses, and treatment plans.
Reporting: Basic reports and summaries of patient visits and inventory levels.

4. Testing and Evaluation

4.1. Testing Summary

The system underwent several rounds of testing, including unit tests for individual functions and integration tests to ensure different modules worked together
seamlessly. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) was conducted with a small group of administrative staff and veterinarians to gather feedback on usability and 
functionality.

4.2. Success Criteria Assessment

Adoption Rate: The goal of 95% prescription generation was not yet measured but is a key metric for post-implementation monitoring.
Efficiency Gain: Preliminary feedback suggests a noticeable reduction in check-in/out times, aligning with the 20% goal.
Data Accuracy: Initial testing showed a significant improvement in data integrity compared to manual records. The 95% inventory accuracy target will 
be measured post-deployment.
User Satisfaction: Initial UAT feedback was positive, with an average satisfaction score of 4.2 out of 5.
System Stability: The MVP was stable during testing, with no critical bugs reported, meeting the success criterion.

5. Conclusion and Recommendations

5.1. Conclusion

The BAU-VTHMS project successfully delivered a foundational digital management system that addresses the hospital's primary operational challenges. 
The system provides a modern, efficient, and reliable platform that enhances patient care, streamlines administrative tasks, 
and serves as a valuable educational tool.

5.2. Recommendations for Future Work

Expand Features: Integrate advanced features like appointment scheduling and billing systems.
External Integration: Develop modules to integrate with external lab equipment for automated data entry.
User Experience (UX) Enhancement: Improve the user interface based on further user feedback to enhance usability.
Mobile Access: Develop a mobile application for quick access to patient records for veterinarians on the go.
Advanced Reporting: Develop more sophisticated analytical and reporting tools for management and research purposes.
Full-Scale Deployment: Finalize the full deployment plan and conduct training for all hospital staff to ensure successful user adoption.
