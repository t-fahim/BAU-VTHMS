# üè• BAU Veterinary Teaching Hospital Management System Final Report

## 1. Executive Summary

The BAU-VTHMS project was initiated to address the operational inefficiencies and data management challenges faced by the BAU Veterinary Teaching Hospital due to its reliance on manual, paper-based systems. The project's primary goal was to develop a digital management system to centralize patient records, improve data accuracy, and enhance the hospital's academic and operational functions. 

The developed Minimum Viable Product (MVP) successfully implemented key features, including patient and owner registration, an Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system, and basic inventory management, thereby achieving significant milestones toward the project's vision.

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Problem & Objectives

The project successfully addressed the core problems of operational inefficiencies, data inconsistencies, and limited data accessibility. The system provides a centralized digital platform that:

- Streamlines patient registration and record retrieval  
- Minimizes human error through digital data validation  
- Offers a readily accessible database for clinical decisions, research, and student learning

### 2.2 Goals Achievement

- **Centralize Data:** Achieved through the creation of a PostgreSQL database repository for all patient, owner, and medical records.  
- **Improve Data Accuracy:** Achieved by implementing digital data entry and validation checks, reducing the risk of manual errors.  
- **Enhance Learning & Research:** The organized digital records provide a structured database for veterinary students and faculty to access case studies.  
- **Reduce Administrative Overhead:** The digital system reduces the time spent on manual paperwork and record-keeping.

## 3. System Design and Implementation

### 3.1 Architecture

The BAU-VTHMS was designed and implemented using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern.

This pattern separates the application‚Äôs:

- **Model:** Handles data logic and database interactions (e.g., patient records, inventory data stored in PostgreSQL)  
- **View:** Manages the user interface, developed using the Tkinter GUI toolkit in Python  
- **Controller:** Processes user input from the View and updates the Model and View accordingly  

This structure ensures modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

### 3.2 Technology Stack

| Component            | Technology     |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Programming Language | Python         |
| GUI Framework        | Tkinter        |
| Database             | PostgreSQL     |

### 3.3 Key Features Delivered

- **User Dashboard:** Overview of daily activities  
- **Patient and Owner Management:** Register and search/retrieve patient and owner records  
- **Electronic Medical Records (EMR):** Record patient history, examinations, diagnoses, and treatment plans  
- **Reporting:** Basic summaries of patient visits and inventory levels

## 4. Testing and Evaluation

### 4.1 Testing Summary

- **Unit Testing:** Individual components tested for expected functionality  
- **Integration Testing:** Ensured modules interact correctly  
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Conducted with administrative staff and veterinarians

### 4.2 Success Criteria Assessment

| Metric                 | Goal                         | Status                         |
|------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Adoption Rate          | 95% prescription generation  | Not yet measured               |
| Efficiency Gain        | 20% reduction in check-in/out| Preliminary feedback positive  |
| Data Accuracy          | 95% inventory accuracy       | Post-deployment measurement    |
| User Satisfaction      | ‚â• 4.0 / 5                    | Achieved (4.2 / 5)             |
| System Stability       | < 5 critical bugs/month      | Achieved (0 critical bugs)     |
